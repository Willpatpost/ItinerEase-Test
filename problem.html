      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        When travelers plan their own trips, all the time, effort, and stress- compounded further by the constraints of group travel- can sour the experience. 
        While the time and effort can be cut down with travel agents and tour guides, they lack the personalized touch of planning for yourself and your needs. 
        76% of travelers turn to planning applications and websites to make the experience easier, but they only provide generic itineraries that lack personalization and flexibility. 
        These leave out the hidden gems that make a trip memorable and also adapt poorly to unforeseen complications. 
        Travelers are left with having to choose between having an expensive or time-consuming planning stage, or they settle for a trip that is just not the experience they were hoping for.
